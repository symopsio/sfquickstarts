# Defensible Analytics using Data Vault and Snowflake
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Defensible Analytics

Today, AI tools interact with data on a daily basis, and enterprises are increasingly recognizing the need for a mature [system of information management](https://datavaultalliance.com/strategy-operating/system-information-management/) that provides **defensible analytics** -- analytics based upon auditable, trustworthy enterprise memory, coupled with clear, unambiguous business context. This is rarely achieved through a series of isolated and disconnected information technology projects. Writing governance documentation that goes unread, is disregarded, or otherwise fails to be executed, is a wasted effort.

Instead, enterprises require a reliable **system of information management**, a system that not only transforms data, but continuously provides connected information, is aligned to business needs, accompanied by business context, using business vocabulary, with auditable lineage to the originating source. This system must generate the evidence needed to make confident decisions, defend those decisions, and enable consistent answers to questions posed through AI agents. This system must be responsive to change, which comes at the speed of business, compatible with an agile approach to implementation, maximizing reuse and avoiding duplication of effort, yet never destroying the auditability and reliability of what has already been delivered.

Data are assets, relevant to our decision-making processes, reducing the effort of, and increasing the quality, speed, and execution of our decisions. Better decision-making improves the performance of our enterprise for all stakeholders. Knowing that, how do we manage information appropriately?

## What is Data Vault

In 2018, at the World-Wide Data Vault Consortium (WWDVC), [Bill Inmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Inmon) presented a slightly updated version of his classic definition of the Data Warehouse. He stated, "A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated (by business key), time-variant and non-volatile collection of data in support of management’s **decision-making** process, and/or in support of **auditability** as a system-of-record." He followed that statement with his recommendation of the Data Vault system to build it. It's important to note that his definition says nothing about schema-on-write or only-structured data. The phrase "collection of data" includes [unstructured](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/unstructured-intro) and [semi-structured](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/semistructured-intro) data. Whether we call it a data warehouse, data lake, or data lakehouse, nothing beats the Snowflake AI Data Cloud when it comes to handling those diverse types of data.

Data Vault, as invented by [Dan Linstedt](https://datavaultalliance.com/#about), is not merely a collection of data modeling standards. Data Vault has always been of a complete system of information management, with key pillars of methodology, architecture, and model, always intended to support informed decision-making processes and deliver real return on investment, impact, business outcomes. This guide cannot possibly detail the entire Data Vault system. To gain a full understanding of Data Vault, we recommend working with experts & partners from [Data Vault Alliance](https://datavaultalliance.com/).

In Data Vault 2.1, Linstedt has clearly articulated a logical architecture consisting of gated [zones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkI1LWsz9Nc). At the core are the Landing Zone, the Enterprise Memory Zone, and the Information Delivery Zone. However, before a functional implementation, the logical architecture must progress to physical. This guide is an introduction to how that may be accomplished in the Snowflake AI Data Cloud.

### Prerequisites

- How to enable domain-oriented development and governance in your Data Vault

### What You’ll Need 
- A Snowflake account -- we recommend starting with a [trial](https://trial.snowflake.com/) account

### What You’ll Build 
- A Data Vault environment using Snowflake


<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Reference Architecture

Let’s start with the overall architecture to put everything in context. 

![dbt_project.yml](assets/multitierdatavaultarchitecture.png)  

On the very left of figure above we have a list of **data sources** that typically include a mix of operational databases, files, streaming event sources, SaaS apps, and more. The [Snowflake Marketplace](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/marketplace/) allows us to tap into 3rd party data to augment our own.

On the very right we have our ultimate **data consumers**: business users, AI agents, data scientists, IT systems or even other companies you decide to share your data with.

Architecturally, we will consider the following zones:
- **Transient Zone**: used to transport ephemeral data from source systems and make it accessible for ingestion into Snowflake. [Snowflake Openflow](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-integration/openflow/about) is an integration service that connects any data source and any destination with hundreds of processors supporting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured text, images, audio, video and sensor data. Additionally, the [Snowflake Ecosystem](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ecosystem) includes a wide array of industry-leading 3rd party tools and technologies that help organzations achieve these goals.
- **Landing Zone**: a managed persistent staging area (PSA), where data is ingested and kept as close as possible to its original state, as established by the source systems it came from. For this Snowflake has [multiple options](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/guides-overview-loading-data), including [bulk loading of files](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-local-file-system), continuous loading of micro-batches of files through [Snowpipe](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-intro), or continuous rows of data through [Snowpipe Streaming](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowpipe-streaming/data-load-snowpipe-streaming-overview). Snowflake allows you to load and store structured, unstructured, and semi-structured in the original format whilst automatically optimizing the physical structure for efficient query access. But this zone isn't just a data dump. Per Data Vault 2.1, in this zone the data is immutable, stored as it was received from source, with no changes to the content. Here, data are [governed](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/guides-overview-govern) as assets. Metadata may be documented, data may be tagged, profiled, and encrypted. Snowflake's [storage lifecycle policies](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/storage-management/storage-lifecycle-policies) may be used to automatically move older data to more cost-effective cool and cold archival tiers, keeping expenses down.
- **Enterprise Memory Zone**: where data become subject-oriented, integrated by business key, time-variant and non-volatile. This is where the data vault modeling patterns -- such as hubs, links, and satellites -- begin to be applied. Data enters the raw vault, sparsely built, where only hard business rules are applied, loading all records received from source.
- **Information Delivery Zone**: a collection of consumer-oriented models, designed to inform decision-making processes. This can be implemented as a set (or multiple sets) of views. It is common to see the use of dimensional models (facts and dimensions, star or snowflake) or denormalized flat tables (for data science or sharing) but it could be any other modeling stye (e.g., unified star schema, supernova, key-value, document object mode, etc.) that fits best for your data consumer. The Business Vault contains data vault objects with soft business rules applied, augmenting the intelligence of the system, and potentially enhancing the performance of the consumer-facing views. Soft business rules may include the calculation of metrics, commonly used aggregations, master data records, PIT and Bridge tables helping to simplify access to bi-temporal view of the data with highly performant views of facts and dimensions. Snowflake’s scalability will support the required speed of access at any point of this data lifecycle. You should consider materialization of Business Vault and other Information Delivery objects as optional. This specific topic (virtualization) is going to be covered later in this article.

With a brand new Snowflake account, objects are not automatically created to represent these logical concepts. We must create them, while building within the constraints of Snowflake's object hierarchy below.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## From Logical Architecture Zones to Implemented Snowflake Objects

If you're familiar with Snowflake's [Data Cloud Deployment Framework (DCDF)](https://www.snowflake.com/en/developers/guides/dcdf-incremental-processing/), you might recognize parallels between the Data Vault zones and the DCDF databases: Raw, Integration, and Presentation. This is because databases are a great place to start for the physical implementation of the logical zones. Databases are not simply containers, but a key aspect of the physical architecture.

In addition to the databases related to our Data Vault zones, a common platform database can serve to hold objects not specific to a specific zone.

For the sake of simplicity, this guide will not delve into utilizing multiple Snowflake accounts. However, adopting a multi-account strategy, taking advantage of Snowflake's remarkable [Secure Data Sharing](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro), could unlock significant value for your organization. A multi-account strategy is one where a single [Organization](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/organizations) has multiple Accounts, each serving a specific purpose. This provides you with the flexibility to distribute databases across multiple accounts, where [shared read-only access to data](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro) with zero copying, and thus enabling the use of different [Editions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-editions), which enable different feature sets and have different compute pricing. Databases may also be [replicated for business continuity and disaster recovery purposes](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/account-replication-config).

### Step 1: Platform Role, Warehouse, and Database

Assuming you are using a new trial account, we'll start with some basics. We'll create a Platform Administrator role, as well as a virtual warehouse to use for basic administrative tasks, and a common platform database for common objects. This is meant to serve only as an example. Your role-based access control (RBAC) strategy and design may differ, but we'll use this example later in the guide.

```sql
-- Platform Administration Role ------------------------------------------------
USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN;

CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS PLT_ADMIN
  COMMENT = 'Platform administrator role for managing shared platform objects';

GRANT ROLE PLT_ADMIN TO ROLE SYSADMIN;

-- Administration Warehouse ----------------------------------------------------
USE ROLE SYSADMIN;

CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS ADMIN_WH
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
  INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE
  COMMENT = 'Administration warehouse for platform admin tasks';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON WAREHOUSE ADMIN_WH TO ROLE PLT_ADMIN;

-- Platform Database -----------------------------------------------------------
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS PLT
  COMMENT = 'Common centralized platform database for shared objects and utilities';

DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS PLT.PUBLIC;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE PLT TO ROLE PLT_ADMIN;
```

### Step 2: Platform Governance Schema

Let's create a schema in the platform database for governance, containing common objects that we'll provide as the platform administrator, or as a central enablement team.

```sql
-- Platform Database content ---------------------------------------------------
USE ROLE PLT_ADMIN;

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS PLT.GOVERNANCE
  WITH MANAGED ACCESS
  COMMENT = 'Platform governance objects including tags, masking and access policies, and common data metric functions';

CREATE DATABASE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS PLT.GOVERNANCE_A
  COMMENT = 'Apply and invoke access to platform governance objects';
CREATE DATABASE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS PLT.GOVERNANCE_W
  COMMENT = 'Create and manage platform governance objects';

GRANT DATABASE ROLE PLT.GOVERNANCE_A TO DATABASE ROLE PLT.GOVERNANCE_W;

GRANT USAGE, MONITOR ON SCHEMA PLT.GOVERNANCE TO DATABASE ROLE PLT.GOVERNANCE_A;

-- GOVERNANCE_A: apply and invoke governance objects
GRANT APPLY ON FUTURE TAGS                   IN SCHEMA PLT.GOVERNANCE TO DATABASE ROLE PLT.GOVERNANCE_A;
GRANT APPLY ON FUTURE MASKING POLICIES       IN SCHEMA PLT.GOVERNANCE TO DATABASE ROLE PLT.GOVERNANCE_A;
GRANT APPLY ON FUTURE ROW ACCESS POLICIES    IN SCHEMA PLT.GOVERNANCE TO DATABASE ROLE PLT.GOVERNANCE_A;
GRANT APPLY ON FUTURE AGGREGATION POLICIES   IN SCHEMA PLT.GOVERNANCE TO DATABASE ROLE PLT.GOVERNANCE_A;
GRANT APPLY ON FUTURE PROJECTION POLICIES    IN SCHEMA PLT.GOVERNANCE TO DATABASE ROLE PLT.GOVERNANCE_A;
GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE DATA METRIC FUNCTIONS  IN SCHEMA PLT.GOVERNANCE TO DATABASE ROLE PLT.GOVERNANCE_A;

-- GOVERNANCE_W: create and manage governance objects
GRANT CREATE TAG                   ON SCHEMA PLT.GOVERNANCE TO DATABASE ROLE PLT.GOVERNANCE_W;
GRANT CREATE MASKING POLICY        ON SCHEMA PLT.GOVERNANCE TO DATABASE ROLE PLT.GOVERNANCE_W;
GRANT CREATE ROW ACCESS POLICY     ON SCHEMA PLT.GOVERNANCE TO DATABASE ROLE PLT.GOVERNANCE_W;
GRANT CREATE AGGREGATION POLICY    ON SCHEMA PLT.GOVERNANCE TO DATABASE ROLE PLT.GOVERNANCE_W;
GRANT CREATE PROJECTION POLICY     ON SCHEMA PLT.GOVERNANCE TO DATABASE ROLE PLT.GOVERNANCE_W;
GRANT CREATE DATA METRIC FUNCTION  ON SCHEMA PLT.GOVERNANCE TO DATABASE ROLE PLT.GOVERNANCE_W;

CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS PLT.GOVERNANCE.INFO_CLASSIFICATION
  ALLOWED_VALUES 'Public', 'Internal', 'Restricted', 'Highly Restricted'
  COMMENT = 'Information classification level, representing the highest level for the data object or column';

CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS PLT.GOVERNANCE.DV_ZONE
  ALLOWED_VALUES 'Landing Zone', 'Enterprise Memory Zone', 'Information Delivery Zone'
  COMMENT = 'Data Vault 2.1 architectural zone';
```

> **Tags, Policies, Data Metric Functions**
>
> This guide could not possibly cover the vast array what is possible using the powerful governance features available. [Cortex Code include built-in data governance skills](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/governance-skills) designed to help you understand, protect, and monitor the data in your Snowflake account.
>
> Snowflake provides a set of built-in Tags — such as `SNOWFLAKE.CORE.SEMANTIC_CATEGORY` and `SNOWFLAKE.CORE.PRIVACY_CATEGORY` — that cover generic sensitive data classification out of the box. Custom Tags stored in `PLT.GOVERNANCE` should encode your organization's specific or Data Vault-specific tags that have no system equivalent. The `INFO_CLASSIFICATION` and `DV_ZONE` tags are examples. You can map user-defined tags to system-defined classification tags. For example, you can set up a tag map so that every time the system tag SNOWFLAKE.CORE.SEMANTIC_CATEGORY = 'NAME' is applied to a column, the custom tag INFO_CLASSIFICATION = 'Highly Restricted' is also applied. See [Sensitive Data Classification](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/classify-intro).
>
> Snowflake's Data Protection Policies, such as [Tag-Based Masking Policies](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tag-based-masking-policies), can be used to mask or filter information classified as restricted, making the detail available only to certain roles.
>
> Snowflake also provides a set of built-in Data Metric Functions (DMFs) — such as `SNOWFLAKE.CORE.NULL_COUNT`, `SNOWFLAKE.CORE.DUPLICATE_COUNT`, and `SNOWFLAKE.CORE.FRESHNESS` — that cover generic quality checks out of the box. Custom DMFs stored in `PLT.GOVERNANCE` should encode Data Vault-specific quality standards that have no system equivalent, such as LDTS staleness, future LDTS values, Hask Key and Business Key duplicates, Ghost Records, and more.
>
> Note that while common *definitions* live in `PLT.GOVERNANCE`, the *attachment* to individual objects happens when those are created. The `GOVERNANCE_A` role's `USAGE` grant enables that attachment step.

### Step 3: Platform Admin Tools Schema

Let's create a schema in the platform database for administration tools, containing helpers we'll use as the platform administrator, reducing repetition and helping achieve consistency later in our deployment.

```sql
USE ROLE PLT_ADMIN;

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS PLT.ADMIN_TOOLS
  WITH MANAGED ACCESS
  COMMENT = 'Common platform administration tools and utilities';

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE PLT.ADMIN_TOOLS.CREATE_SCHEMA_AND_ROLES(
    DATABASE_NAME   VARCHAR,
    SCHEMA_NAME     VARCHAR,
    SCHEMA_SUBJECT  VARCHAR

    RETURN 'SUCCESS: Created schema ' || v_db || '.' || v_schema
        || ' with roles ' || v_schema || '_R, ' || v_schema || '_W.';
END;
$$;

### Step 4: Landing Zone Database

Let's create a database that will serve as our Landing Zone, as well as a role and warehouse designed for ingesting data.

```sql
-- Development LZ Ingestion Role -----------------------------------------------
USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN;

CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS DEV_LZ_INGEST
  COMMENT = 'Ingestion role for the development landing zone';

GRANT ROLE DEV_LZ_INGEST TO ROLE SYSADMIN;

-- Development LZ Ingestion Warehouse ------------------------------------------
USE ROLE SYSADMIN;

CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS DEV_INGEST_WH
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
  INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE
  COMMENT = 'Warehouse for automated data ingestion workloads';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON WAREHOUSE DEV_INGEST_WH TO ROLE PLT_ADMIN;
GRANT USAGE, OPERATE ON WAREHOUSE DEV_INGEST_WH TO ROLE DEV_LZ_INGEST;

-- Development LZ Ingestion Warehouse ------------------------------------------
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS DEV_LZ
  COMMENT = 'Development landing zone for raw data ingestion';

DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS DEV_LZ.PUBLIC;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE DEV_LZ TO ROLE PLT_ADMIN;
```

> **Development Environment**
>
> You may note that this serves as a development environment example. Objects developed here might later be promoted to a TST_LZ for testing, and then a main LZ, for production use. We're leaving those out here for the sake of brevity. However, in those test and production environments, ingestion of data is typically performed by an automated Service User. In the event multiple Service Users will be used to ingest data using multiple solutions, you may wish to create multiple ingestion roles.

### Step 5: Enterprise Memory and Information Delivery Zone Databases

Now, let's create two more databases. The first will serve as our Data Vault, holding staging, raw vault, and business vault objects. The second will serve as our analyst-facing interface to the Information Delivery Zone. We'll also create a role and a warehouse for engineering (development and testing) use, and a warehouse for automated transforming data.

```sql
-- Analysis Role ---------------------------------------------------------------
USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN;

CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS QA_ANALYST;
  COMMENT = 'General analyst role with read-only access to the information delivery zone';

GRANT ROLE QA_ANALYST TO ROLE PLT_ADMIN;


-- Data Transformation and Engineering Warehouses ------------------------------
USE ROLE SYSADMIN;

CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS DEV_XFORM_WH
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
  INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE
  COMMENT = 'Warehouse for automated data transformation workloads';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON WAREHOUSE DEV_XFORM_WH TO ROLE PLT_ADMIN;

CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS ENGINEERING_WH
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
  INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE
  COMMENT = 'Warehouse for general development and testing use';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON WAREHOUSE ENGINEERING_WH TO ROLE PLT_ADMIN;
GRANT USAGE, OPERATE ON WAREHOUSE ENGINEERING_WH TO ROLE QA_ANALYST;

-- Data Vault Database ---------------------------------------------------------
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS DEV_DV
  COMMENT = 'Enterprise memory of domain-oriented data vault models';

DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS DEV_DV.PUBLIC;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE DEV_DV TO ROLE PLT_ADMIN;

-- Data Warehouse Database -----------------------------------------------------
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS DEV_DW
  COMMENT = 'Information delivery of domain-oriented models';

DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS DEV_DW.PUBLIC;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE DEV_DW TO ROLE PLT_ADMIN;
```

> **Transformation and Ingestion Privileges**
>
> You may be wondering, why did we not grant privileges to the ingestion role, nor ever create a role for transforming data in the data vault? We will do this later, after the schemas in these databases are in place.

## Business Architecture, Domains and Ontologies

It is critical that our Business Architecture inform our Information Architecture. Let's take a moment to think about how business architecture would guide these next these examples.

### Domains

Business architecture can be organized conceptually into a **hierarchy of domains**. Eric Evans, in the book Domain Driven Design, defines a **domain** as, "a sphere of knowledge, influence, or activity." It is important to recognize that, assuming your organization has been performing business activities regularly, these domains already exist. They can be typically be recognized and diagramed in a hierarchy, where domains can be broken into sub-domains. The business **activities** in these domains **originate data** as valuable assets, not waste byproducts.

Also, a domain's business activities can rarely function without using data originating from other domains as input. For example, the **Finance** activity of accounting for revenue recognition in the prior quarter depends on invoicing information associated with fulfilled orders, that invoice data originating from activities in **Customer Service**. Before being invoiced, those orders were fulfilled by activities in **Manufacturing & Delivery**. Those orders originated with activities in **Sales & Marketing**. Placed but unfulfilled orders, or possibly just a Sales & Marketing expectation of future orders, might inform a Finance domain's Revenue Forecast. The people performing all those activities are all hired, tracked and managed through activities in the **Workforce** domain. And those workers were likely first given an email address through activities the **IT Delivery** domain. The complex web of connections between domains is difficult,if not impossible, to diagram or comprehend in total. Within the perspective of only a single domain, understanding is more easily achieved.

> Note: The domain examples above are inspired by the [TBM Taxonomy](https://www.tbmcouncil.org/learn-tbm/resource-center/the-tbm-taxonomy/).

### Domain Taxonomy and Ontologies

The business processes, as performed in an organization, along with business keys (how the people performing theos activities identify things), units of work that connect business keys, descriptive information produced by activities, what technology systems are used, and input/output connections to other domains, can all be formally described in **ontologies**. These ontologies can be captured in simple text documents, or aided by knowledge graph. And because each domain has a web of connections to other domains, not just hierarchical relationships, that domain hierarchy becomes a **domain taxonomy**. When getting started, don't attempt to "boil the ocean," but rather limit scope to a prioritized set of specific business objectives. However, it is important that what is formally documented is captured accurately, utilizing the domain expertise of those performing these business processes, reviewing with and gaining the formal approval of those who have dominion over the given domain(s). You don't want a documented ontology of the Finance domain that the CFO does not recognize or approve of. Every domain, when formally documented, should have an obvious authority figure, already having dominion over the activities, processes, and business vocabulary used within that domain.

As an example, we'll consider the following simple domain hierarchy, starting with just two domains, Sales & Marketing and Customer Service.

![dbt_project.yml](assets/exampledomains.png)

With Snowflake, schema objects -- which include tables, views, stages, files formats, pipes, streams, UDFs, stored procedures, and more -- always exist within a schema. While access control is possible at the schema object level, assigning privileges on each individual object, doing so at that grain quickly becomes tedious and costly to maintain. When objects with common access control objectives are grouped together into schemas, maintaining access controls becomes much easier. Real-world governance is almost always domain-oriented. Thus, we'll use domain-oriented schemas to organize the objects in our Enterprise Memory Zone and beyond, promoting domain-oriented governance.


<!-- ------------------------ -->
## From Logical Business Architecture to Implementation

### Step 6: Sample Source System Schema

In a real world scenario, because the data in the Landing Zone is source-system-oriented, a schema found in a Landing Zone database should be associated with a source system. For the sake of simplicity, let's create a single schema designed to land ingested sample data from the TPC-H decision support benchmark.

```sql
USE ROLE PLT_ADMIN;

CALL PLT.ADMIN_TOOLS.CREATE_LZ_SCHEMA_AND_ROLES('DEV_LZ', 'TPCH', 'TPC-H Sample Data');

GRANT DATABASE ROLE DEV_LZ.TPHC_W TO ROLE DEV_LZ_INGEST;
```

> Note the simplicity of creating the TPCH source schema and granting write access to the functional role DEV_LZ_INGEST, by utilizing a common stored procedure that creates the managed access schema, access roles, and privileges to those access roles.

### Step 7: Domain-Oriented Schemas

Now, let's create domain-oriented schemas in the DV and DW databases, representing our Enterprise Memory and Information Delivery Zones.

```sql
USE ROLE PLT_ADMIN;

CALL PLT.ADMIN_TOOLS.CREATE_DOMAIN_SCHEMA_AND_ROLES('DEV_DV', 'SALESMKT', 'Sales & Marketing');
CALL PLT.ADMIN_TOOLS.CREATE_DOMAIN_SCHEMA_AND_ROLES('DEV_DW', 'SALESMKT', 'Sales & Marketing');
CALL PLT.ADMIN_TOOLS.CREATE_DOMAIN_SCHEMA_AND_ROLES('DEV_DV', 'CUSTSERV', 'Customer Service');
CALL PLT.ADMIN_TOOLS.CREATE_DOMAIN_SCHEMA_AND_ROLES('DEV_DW', 'CUSTSERV', 'Customer Service');
```
> Note that while the stored proceure creates the schemas and access roles, we don't yet have domain-oriented functional roles to which we may grant the access roles.

### Step 8: Domain-Oriented Roles and Privileges

Now, let's create domain-oriented functional roles, and grant access allowing for reading from the landing zone and other domain's data vault objects, but writing only to the domain-specific schemas in the Enterprise Memory and Information Delivery Zones. We grant read access to the entire Landing Zone, because source systems are often not domain specific. A domain-specific Landing Zone database could be used for a set of source systems restricted to just one domain. We grant cross-domain read access to the data vault models to avoid duplication of efforts and promote effective governance, while allowing one domain to leverage curated information from another. We restrict writing to the domain-specific roles, promoting accountability and effective governance over what is built.

```sql
USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN;

CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS SALESMKT_ENGINEER;
  COMMENT = 'Data engineering role for the development of Sales & Marketing objects and transformations';
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS CUSTSERV_ENGINEER;
  COMMENT = 'Data engineering role for the development of Customer Service objects and transformations';

GRANT USAGE, OPERATE ON WAREHOUSE ENGINEERING_WH TO ROLE SALESMKT_ENGINEER;
GRANT USAGE, OPERATE ON WAREHOUSE DEV_XFORM_WH TO ROLE SALESMKT_ENGINEER;

GRANT USAGE, OPERATE ON WAREHOUSE ENGINEERING_WH TO ROLE CUSTSERV_ENGINEER;
GRANT USAGE, OPERATE ON WAREHOUSE DEV_XFORM_WH TO ROLE CUSTSERV_ENGINEER;


USE ROLE PLT_ADMIN;

GRANT DATABASE ROLE DEV_LZ.DB_R TO ROLE SALESMKT_ENGINEER;
GRANT DATABASE ROLE DEV_DV.SALESMKT_W TO ROLE SALESMKT_ENGINEER;
GRANT DATABASE ROLE DEV_DV.DB_R TO ROLE SALESMKT_ENGINEER;
GRANT DATABASE ROLE DEV_DW.SALESMKT_W TO ROLE SALESMKT_ENGINEER;

GRANT DATABASE ROLE DEV_LZ.DB_R TO ROLE CUSTSERV_ENGINEER;
GRANT DATABASE ROLE DEV_DV.SALESMKT_W TO ROLE CUSTSERV_ENGINEER;
GRANT DATABASE ROLE DEV_DV.DB_R TO ROLE CUSTSERV_ENGINEER;
GRANT DATABASE ROLE DEV_DW.SALESMKT_W TO ROLE CUSTSERV_ENGINEER;

GRANT DATABASE ROLE DEV_DW.DB_R TO ROLE QA_ANALYST;
```

## Conclusion And Resources

We covered some of the basics to get started. As an architect, you may be considering creating a test and main production environments; or additional tags, access policies, and data metric functions; or additional common functions and stored procedures; or a Presentation Zone database for custom customer-facing data shares or Streamlit apps and dashboards. 

You are now ready to advance to the [next guide, Building a Real-Time Data Vault in Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/developers/guides/vhol-data-vault/)! Data Vault 2.x consists of 3 pillars -- methodology, architecture, and model -- and while this guide focuses on architecture, the next guide focuses on modeling. We've updated that guide to leverage the structure defined here, as well as adding some new content, such as Dynamic Tables and Data Metric Functions.
