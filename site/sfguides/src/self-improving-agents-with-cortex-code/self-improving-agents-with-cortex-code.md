# Self-Improving Agents with Cortex Code

## Overview

Building AI agents is just the beginning — understanding how well they perform and systematically improving them is what separates prototypes from production systems. In this guide, you'll build a marketing analytics agent, deploy it to production, stress-test it with hard queries, then use Cortex Code to mine failures from logs, evaluate with Agent GPA, and optimize the agent's instructions.

By the end, you'll have a versioned agent with measurably better performance — and a repeatable workflow for continuous improvement.

| Step | What You'll Do |
|------|---------------|
| Setup | Deploy a production agent with 5 tools (VERSION$1) |
| Stress Test | Run hard queries in Snowflake Intelligence to generate failure traces |
| Evaluate | Mine logs, curate an eval dataset, run Agent GPA baseline |
| Optimize | Analyze failures, generate improved instructions (VERSION$2), validate with a second eval |

### What You'll Learn

- How to build a Cortex Agent with multiple tool types (Cortex Analyst, Cortex Search, stored procedures, web search, data-to-chart)
- How to use Snowflake Intelligence to interact with your agent and generate observability traces
- How to use Cortex Code to mine agent logs and curate evaluation datasets
- How to run Agent GPA evaluations with built-in metrics
- How to analyze failure patterns and generate improved orchestration instructions
- How to validate improvements by comparing evaluation scores across agent versions

### What You'll Build

A complete agent optimization workflow:

- A marketing campaigns agent with 5 tools deployed as VERSION$1
- An evaluation dataset curated from real agent interaction logs
- An optimized VERSION$2 with improved orchestration instructions
- Before/after evaluation results demonstrating measurable improvement

### What You'll Need

- A [Snowflake account](https://signup.snowflake.com/?utm_source=snowflake-devrel&utm_medium=developer-guides&utm_cta=developer-guides) with ACCOUNTADMIN access
- [Cross-region inference](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-suite-cross-region) enabled (required for evaluation LLM judge models)
- ~5 minutes for setup script to complete

### Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with Snowflake SQL and Cortex Agents
- Python 3.8+ (for Cortex Code CLI installation)

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Install Cortex Code

Cortex Code is an AI-powered CLI that you'll use throughout this guide to mine agent logs, run evaluations, analyze failures, and generate improved agent instructions.

Install it via pip:

```bash
pip install snowflake-cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
cortex --version
```

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Cortex Code docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/cortex-code/cortex-code).

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Run Setup

Download the [`setup.sql`](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-self-improving-agents-with-cortex-code/blob/main/assets/setup.sql) file from the repository.

Open a Snowflake worksheet in Snowsight and run the entire `setup.sql` file. This creates:

- Database `SELF_IMPROVING_AGENT_DB` with schema `AGENTS`
- 4 data tables (25 campaigns, ~1578 performance records, content, feedback)
- Semantic view, Cortex Search service, report generation procedure
- The production agent `MARKETING_CAMPAIGNS_AGENT` (VERSION$1)

Verify setup succeeded — the final statement should print a success banner.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Stress-Test the Agent in Snowflake Intelligence

Open the agent in Snowflake Intelligence:

1. Go to [ai.snowflake.com](https://ai.snowflake.com) or in Snowsight select **AI & ML > Agents**
2. Select **MARKETING_CAMPAIGNS_AGENT**

The agent is deployed as VERSION$1. Your goal is to generate a mix of successful and failing traces by asking progressively harder questions. Copy-paste these one at a time:

### Simple queries (agent should handle these well)

- `What is the total spend across all campaigns?`
- `What content was used in the Summer Sale campaign?`
- `Which campaign had the highest ROI?`

### Multi-tool queries (requires 3+ tools — agent will miss steps)

- `Which campaign had the highest ROI and what did customers say about it? Generate a report for that campaign too.`
- `Find our worst performing campaigns, look up what customers complained about, compare to industry benchmarks, and recommend fixes`

### Complex synthesis queries (agent won't know where to start)

- `For each of our top 5 campaigns by revenue, show me the customer feedback and whether the A/B test results support scaling them up`
- `Build me a quarterly business review — top campaigns, underperformers, customer sentiment trends, and how we stack up against competitors`

Notice the patterns: simple queries work fine, but the agent fails on multi-tool coordination and complex synthesis. These traces are now logged and ready to mine.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Curate an Eval Dataset from Logs

Now open Cortex Code to mine the agent's interaction logs and curate an evaluation dataset:

```bash
cortex --bypass
```

Then enter the following prompt:

```
Use the dataset-curation skill to pull observability traces for
SELF_IMPROVING_AGENT_DB.AGENTS.MARKETING_CAMPAIGNS_AGENT and curate
an evaluation dataset. Include a mix of:
- Simple queries the agent handles well
- Multi-tool queries where it struggles
- Complex synthesis queries it fails on

For each query, include ground truth with expected tool invocations.
Store it in SELF_IMPROVING_AGENT_DB.AGENTS and register it as an
evaluation dataset called DS_EVAL.
```

Cortex Code will:

1. Query the observability traces from the previous step
2. Help you select and annotate queries with ground truth
3. Create an eval table and register it via `SYSTEM$CREATE_EVALUATION_DATASET`

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Run Baseline Evaluation

Run Agent GPA on your curated dataset. Enter this prompt in Cortex Code:

```
Run an evaluation of SELF_IMPROVING_AGENT_DB.AGENTS.MARKETING_CAMPAIGNS_AGENT
against the DS_EVAL dataset. Use the default Agent GPA metrics:
answer_correctness, logical_consistency, groundedness, execution_efficiency,
and tool_selection. Upload the config to a stage in
SELF_IMPROVING_AGENT_DB.AGENTS and kick off the eval.
```

Once the eval completes, analyze the results:

```
Show me the evaluation results. Break down scores by metric and
identify which queries scored lowest. What are the common failure patterns?
```

### GPA Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `answer_correctness` | Is the answer factually right? |
| `tool_selection` | Did the agent pick the right tool(s)? |
| `groundedness` | Are claims backed by evidence from tool outputs? |
| `execution_efficiency` | Was the tool usage minimal and efficient? |
| `logical_consistency` | Is the reasoning coherent? |

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Optimize and Validate

### Analyze failures

Enter this prompt in Cortex Code:

```
Dig into the lowest-scoring queries from the eval of
SELF_IMPROVING_AGENT_DB.AGENTS.MARKETING_CAMPAIGNS_AGENT. Show me the
actual tool calls the agent made vs what ground truth expected. What
patterns do you see?
```

**Common failure patterns you'll see:**

- Agent uses only one tool when the query needs both quantitative AND qualitative data
- Report generation fails because the agent doesn't look up `campaign_id` first
- Vague answers that don't combine data from multiple sources

### Generate improved instructions

```
Based on the failure analysis, generate improved orchestration instructions
for SELF_IMPROVING_AGENT_DB.AGENTS.MARKETING_CAMPAIGNS_AGENT that fix
the identified issues. The instructions should tell the agent when to use
multiple tools and in what order. Apply the changes and commit as VERSION$2.
```

Cortex Code will:

1. Draft improved orchestration instructions with explicit tool routing rules
2. Apply via `ALTER AGENT ... MODIFY LIVE VERSION SET SPECIFICATION = ...`
3. Commit as VERSION$2

**What changes:** Only the `instructions.orchestration` field. Tools, tool_resources, and models stay identical. Better instructions are the only lever.

### Validate with a second eval

```
Run the evaluation of SELF_IMPROVING_AGENT_DB.AGENTS.MARKETING_CAMPAIGNS_AGENT
against DS_EVAL again, this time for VERSION$2. Compare the results
against the VERSION$1 baseline — show me a side-by-side comparison of
scores by metric and highlight what improved.
```

**What to look for:**

- **Overall score improvement**: VERSION$2 should score higher across all metrics
- **Tool selection gains**: The biggest improvement should be in `tool_selection` — the agent now chains tools correctly
- **No regressions**: VERSION$2 should still handle simple queries just as well as VERSION$1

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Review

Ask Cortex Code to summarize the full optimization:

```
Show me a summary of everything we did — both agent versions, what changed
in the instructions, the eval runs, and the score comparison.
```

You can also inspect agent versions directly:

```sql
SHOW VERSIONS IN AGENT SELF_IMPROVING_AGENT_DB.AGENTS.MARKETING_CAMPAIGNS_AGENT;
```

### Explore Observability Traces

Ask Cortex Code to dig into what the agent actually did:

```
Show me the observability traces for
SELF_IMPROVING_AGENT_DB.AGENTS.MARKETING_CAMPAIGNS_AGENT. Find an example
where V1 failed and V2 succeeded on the same query — compare the tool
calls and reasoning.
```

<!-- ------------------------ -->
